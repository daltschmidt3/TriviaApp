This Android app was created for Mike Scott's Mobile Development class at UT
Austin Fall 2013 by Dalton Schmidt and Clay Tobolka. The intention of this 
app was to create a platform to allow users to asynchronously challenge each
other to a game, in this case, a trivia challenge.  My intention is to use 
this platform to create other games (such as a race or math quiz) and allow 
more than 2 people participate in a challenge.


Libraries used in this app were:

- PullToRefresh-Listview: https://github.com/erikwt/PullToRefresh-ListView
- The Parse API and SDK for Complete back end support from user creation, 
  login, interaction, and database:  https://www.parse.com/docs/android_guide

Created by:  Clay Tobolka(cjt628) and Dalton Schmidt(dps585) for CS371 Mobile Computing at 
The University of Texas at Austin Fall 2013 Semester.

How to setup environment for Beta Release:

	Make sure that the PullToRefreshListView project is defined as a library
	Make sure that the TriviaApp has the PullToRefreshListView as a library


How To use the App:

        Login/Signup Activity:

          On a fresh install, the user is brought to a login screen. If the credentials are known, 
          the user can just login but there is a Sign up button that takes the user to a register 
          screen.  The only credentials that the user needs to enter to sign up are a username and 
          password and email (No email verification needed).  The user information is cached so there
          is no need to login again unless the user explicity logs out.

          We have test accounts setup:

             username: test  password: 123
             username: test2 password 321


          Main Activity:

          The users main page is a list of all challenges and their current status/outcome.  If the 
          user sees where he has been challenged, all he has to do is click that item and he will be
          directed to the game activity where he will answer questions that the challenger was asked.

          There is a + button on the top right where the user can create a challenge.  From here he is 
          directed to the New Game Activity
          
        New Game Activity:

          This activity has a list of all current people he can challenge.  To initiate a challenge, the user 
          taps an opponent, chooses a category and then initiates the game by pressing the "Start New Game Button".
          From here the user is directed to the game activity and is asked questions regarding the category.

        Game Activity:

          The game activity is initiated from two points of view, the challenger or the opponent.

            Challenger:  The challenger is given a set of 10 questions that he must answer.  There 
            is a running clock and a counter of the number of questions he got right.  Once the user
            selects an answer, the screen quickly changes to the next question.  On the last question,
            information about the game is saved (numCorrect, time, challenger, opponent, questions) to 
            the database and the user is directed back to the Main Activity and the game will be displayed 
            saying that it is waiting for the opponent to complete the game.

            Opponent:  The opponent will be asked the same questions as the challenger in the same manner.  
            The only difference is when the last question is answered, the game is actually evaluated and
            the results are pushed to the database.  A Toast Message will popup noftifying the results
            and the user will be redirected to the Main Activity and can see the completed challenge.
